An e-mail sends digital messages to one or many people via the internet. E-mail is widely known as an electronic e-mail and contains three parts: the message envelope, the message header, and the message body. An e-mail gets passed around a bit before it ends up in the correct inbox. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) sends the e-mail and pings the recipient then a DNS (Domain Name Server) finds the domain name and lastly a POP (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Mail Access Prompt) gets the e-mail to the awaiting recipient. A DNS plays a big part in all of this as it gets you one step closer to the desired location. It is a massive name look up which figures out where an e-mail needs to go or which site to send you to when you type a URL into the address bar.
